# Advent_Of_Code_2023
## My files for completing [advent of code, 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). I started on the 9th of december.
1. [Trebuchet?!](https://github.com/TheFosh/adventOfCode_2023/tree/main/day1/day1): Given a list of strings, each containing at least 1 number in it, I must find the numbers and combine them into a two digit number. The first number found is the first digit, and the second found is the second. Find this for all lines and add numbers together for the answer to the puzzle.
## Will maybe do more after.
